# Welcome!

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe Squared! The rules of the game are simple.
There are 9 Tic-Tac-Toe boards arranged into 3 columns and 3 rows. Each turn, a player may make a single move in any one of the 9 game instances.
Every time a player wins one of the game instances, they claim that corresponding tile in the meta-game. The game ends when a player wins the meta-game.

Please note that the boards and tiles are numbered from 0 through 8.
