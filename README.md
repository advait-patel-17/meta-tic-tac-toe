# Welcome!

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe Squared! The rules of the game are simple.
There are 9 Tic-Tac-Toe boards arranged into 3 columns and 3 rows. Each turn, a player may make a single move in any one of the 9 game instances.
Every time a player wins one of the game instances, they claim that corresponding tile in the meta-game. Game instances that end in a tie automatically clear and become playable again. The game ends when a player has claimed an entire row, column, or diagonal in the meta-game.

Please note that the boards and tiles are numbered from 0 through 8.

In order to play, clone this repository and use the command line to navigate to the folder that "main.py" is located in. Then run "python main.py". Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
